Thank you for your interest in my research! My work involves analyzing the gravitational wave event GW230529. The source binary of this event contains a primary object in the 
lower mass gap, but the properties of the objects in the system remain uncertain. The hypothesis that the gravitational wave signal resulted from a merger between a low-mass black hole 
and a neutron star has the greatest support, but there is also a possibility that the source may have been a merger between two heavy binary neutron stars. The research note
contained in this repository provides a description of the scientific question we have been trying to answer, as well as our methods and the results we found. This research note is the 
result of a summer spent doing research with Northwestern University's CIERA (Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics) as a part of the REU program.
